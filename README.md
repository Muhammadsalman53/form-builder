# form-builder

This is our Drag and Drop Project in which we focus on both admin and user side interfaces.
In admin side dashboard, it has power to delete user completely and accept or reject user Json form.
In user side dashboard, it has power to create drag and drop form and see it for itself in self and request for publish from admin.
We used autentication on login and sign-up that if email and password is match with admin the response will come for admin then we go to admin dashboard.
Otherwise it is user then we go to User dashboard.
We click on request to publish button it send json to api and link will be generated regarding that user json.
